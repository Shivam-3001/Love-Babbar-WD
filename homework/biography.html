      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian Nationalist whose patriotism
        towards India has left a mark in the hearts of many Indians. He is
        famously known as the founder of 'Azad Hind Fauj' and his famous slogan is
        'Tum Mujhe Khoon Do, Main Tumhe Aazadi Dunga'. He was influenced by the
        teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Ramakrishna after reading their works
        at the age of 16. He then was sent by his parents to the University of
        Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he
        passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of
        the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried
        back to India.
